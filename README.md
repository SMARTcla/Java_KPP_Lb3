Develop a program that keeps track of readers and books in the library. To do this, create a set of classes representing the library (Author, Book, Bookcase, Reader, Rent, ...). Each class must have a default constructor, getters and setters, an overridden toString() method, and methods that implement basic functionality. Using the serialization mechanism, save the current state of the system to a file and then restore the system from this file. Implement three versions of the program that implement different serialization strategies:
1. all classes included in the system are serializable (implement the java.io.Serializable interface);
2. not all classes of the system are serializable (implementing the java.io.Serializable interface): the classes Author, Reader, Book are NOT serializable;
3. The classes included in the system implement the java.io.Externalizable interface.
The first version of the program should be executed as a console application, in the main function of which the operation of the system is shown: a “library” with books and a list of readers has been created; several books have been published; information about the current state of the library is displayed; serialization and deserialization; shows the state of the deserialized system.
